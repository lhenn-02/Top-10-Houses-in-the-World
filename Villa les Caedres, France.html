<li>Originally known as ‘Les Oiseaux,’ villa Les Cèdres in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat was a private home constructed by the Jewish, Nice-based family Pollonnais. Its transformation into a prestigious estate and adoption of the current name happened in 1904 when Belgian King Leopold II purchased the property, using it as an illustrious second residence. Notably, during World War I, Les Cèdres served as a hospital for wounded soldiers. In 1924, the estate changed hands and was acquired by Alexandre Marnier Lapostolle, the creator of Grand Marnier. The ownership transitioned to Gruppo Campari and, in 2019, the villa was sold to Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov for $200 million, adding another chapter to the rich history of this remarkable property.
