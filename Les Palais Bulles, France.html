<li>The 1,200 m2 (13,000 sq ft)[2] house was built between 1975 and 1989 for Pierre Bernard, a French industrialist. The architect Antti Lovag hated straight lines as "an aggression against nature" and designed the house as a "form of play—spontaneous, joyful, full of surprise". Fashion designer Pierre Cardin bought the house after Bernard's death in 1991. While Bernard never actually lived in the building, he said that "[t]his palace has become my own bit of paradise. Its cellular forms have long reflected the outward manifestations of the image of my creations. It is a museum where I exhibit the works of contemporary designers and artists".In 2016, a five-year renovation by French architect Odile Decq was completed.[4][5] In March 2017, it was listed for sale with an asking price of €350 million[1] but did not find a buyer. It could be rented to groups for $33,200 a day. Following Cardin's death in December 2020, it has been suggested that the building be turned into a public venue for art expos.
