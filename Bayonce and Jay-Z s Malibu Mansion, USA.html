<li>Jay-Z and Beyonc√© have just snagged one of the greatest architectural masterpieces in the country ... a 30,000-square-foot home in the prime area of Malibu ... and they paid a King's ransom.
<li>Real estate sources tell TMZ ... the couple paid $200 million for the property, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the entire state of California ... eclipsing the previous record of $177 million. It's also the second most expensive real estate deal in the country -- the top being $238 million for an NYC apartment.
